            <p>Self-driving cars, assistants that instantly translate from one language to another, or personalized shopping suggestions. Complex tasks that were once a pipe dream are today possible thanks to 'Machine Learning', a discipline that allows computers to learn by themselves and perform tasks autonomously without the need to be programmed.</p>

                In his book On Intelligence, published in 2004, Jeff Hawkins defined intelligence as the ability to predict the future, for example, the weight of a glass that we are going to lift or the reaction of others to our actions, based on the patterns stored in memory (the memory-prediction framework).
